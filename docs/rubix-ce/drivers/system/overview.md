# Overview

The system module serves a dual purpose within the system:

**Generic Points Driver**: This functionality enables the system module to handle points in a non-protocol-specific manner. It allows for the management and control of various types of points, such as sensors, actuators, and other devices, without being tied to a specific communication protocol.

**Time Schedules**: Additionally, the system module facilitates the implementation and management of time schedules. It provides the capability to define and execute schedules for various system operations, such as device activations, alarms, or data logging, based on specific time criteria.
