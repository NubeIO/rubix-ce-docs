# Migrations 


# from flow-framework to rubix-os Aug 2023

Any rubix-compute-5 can be updated by Nube-iO at anytime on request. <br/>
The process takes around 5 minutes an no data will be lost <br/>

reason for the migration
- we have combined `rubix-assist`, `rubix-edge` and `flow-framework` into a new platform called `rubix-os`
- we have added dashboard `views` which will allow user to read/write points and schedule's via the Nube-iO app
- we are building in support for being able to write `flow` based programs and download them to the IO-16


:::danger backwards compatible
Rubic CE is not backwards compatible to Nube-iO flow-framework or rubix-platform <br/>
rubix-wires is not backwards compatible to rubix-edge-wires <br/>
`rubix-os` is not compatible on the Nube-iO `edge-28`
