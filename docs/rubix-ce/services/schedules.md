## Schedules
Schedules are primarily utilized for controlling HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) equipment based on predefined time schedules. To set up a schedule, `ensure that the system module is installed`. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open the `device` you wish to add a schedule to from the sidebar under its `services`.
2. Click on the Add button ![add-button.png](../img/apps/add-button.png)
3. Enter the `name` for the schedule.
4. Enter the `timezone` for the schedule. You can search for the desired timezone using the provided options.

By following these steps, you can easily create and configure schedules to automate a system based on specific time criteria.

### Event 
An event schedule allows you to override the regular 7-day schedule and set a specific device to an `ON state` for a defined period of time. For example, you might want to activate a device from the 24th of November 2022 at 8 am until the 24th of November 2022 at 1 am.

### Weekly
a weekly schedule is a recurring schedule that operates from Monday to Sunday, covering a span of 7 days. Here's how you can set up a weekly schedule to turn on the HVAC every morning at 9 am and turn it off at 5 pm, specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays:

1. Open the device you want to schedule from the sidebar under its services.
2. Click on the Add button ![add-button.png](../img/apps/add-button.png) to create a new schedule.
3. Enter a name for the weekly schedule.
4. Set the `Time On` to 9 am and the `Time Off` to 5 pm.
5. Specify the days of the week when the schedule should be active. In this case, select `Monday`, `Tuesday`, and `Wednesday`.
6. Save the weekly schedule.

By configuring the weekly schedule in this manner, you ensure that the HVAC system will automatically turn on at 9 am and turn off at 5 pm, but only on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, following the specified weekly schedule.


### Exception 
Is designed for overriding the regular 7-day schedule to set a device to an `OFF state` for a specified duration. For instance, you might want to deactivate a device from the 25th of December 2022 at 8 am until the 26th of December 2022 at 8 am.
