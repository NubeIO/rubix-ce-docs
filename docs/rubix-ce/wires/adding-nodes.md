### Adding Nodes from the Node Palette


To add nodes from the Node Palette in Rubix Wires, follow these steps:

1. Open the Node Palette, which displays different node groups.
2. Click on a node group to expand it, revealing the available nodes within that group.
3. Locate the specific node you want to add to your workflow.
4. Click and drag the desired node from the Node Palette to the Editor Pane.
5. Release the mouse button to drop the node onto the Editor Pane.
6. The selected node will now be added to the Editor Pane, where you can further configure and connect it as needed within your workflow.

## Node Palette Search


To facilitate finding nodes quickly in the Node Palette, Rubix Wires offers a search feature located at the top of the Node Palette. Here's how it works:

1. Locate the search bar at the top of the Node Palette.
2. Type your desired search term or keyword into the search bar.
3. As you type, the Node Palette will dynamically filter the nodes displayed, showing only those that match the search terms.
4. Browse through the filtered nodes to find the one you're looking for.
5. Once you find the desired node, you can click and drag it from the Node Palette to the Editor Pane to add it to your workflow.

## Cloning nodes

Nodes can be cloned (duplicated) by selecting `ctrl-d`

## Removing Nodes

To remove nodes in Rubix Wires, you can use the following methods:

**Remove a Single Node:**

1. Click on the node you want to remove to select it.
2. Press the delete key on your keyboard. This will delete the selected node.

**Remove Multiple Nodes:**

1. Hold down the shift key on your keyboard.
2. Click on each node you want to remove while holding the shift key. This will select multiple nodes, and an outline will appear around each selected node.
3. Once you have selected all the desired nodes, press the delete key on your keyboard. This will delete all the selected nodes simultaneously.

## Node Settings

Each node on the Editor Pane in Rubix Wires has settings that can be configured to adjust its function or labeling. These settings are unique to each individual node and can be customised as needed. <br/><br/>
Simply **double-click** on the node that you want to edit. This action will open up the settings interface for that particular node, allowing you to modify its configuration.<br/>
Alternatively, you can **right-click** on the node.
From the context menu that appears, select the `Edit Settings` option. This will open the settings interface for the selected node, where you can make the necessary adjustments.

## Node Inputs and Outputs

 Nodes have various inputs and outputs depending on their specific function within the workflow. These inputs and outputs allow nodes to send and receive data, enabling the creation of complex logic and functionalities. Additionally, many nodes come with settings that can modify the available inputs and outputs, providing flexibility and customization options.

### Node Inputs

Node inputs provide values to be used in computing the nodeâ€™s outputs. Wire links can be connected to the left hand side
of node input slots. The image below shows the 4 inputs of a `min-on-off` node.

### Node Inputs value

A node supports the option to write a value directly in the input rather than connecting in another node

### Variable Input Counts

Many nodes have a setting which will create/remove node inputs.

Example of some nodes that support this: **Math/Add** **Bool/And**

### Node Outputs

Node outputs are the results of a nodes specific function. Wire links can be connected from the right hand side of node
output slots. The image below shows the 1 output of a const-num node.
