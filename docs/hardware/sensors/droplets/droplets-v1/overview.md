# Overview

The Droplet is a LoRa® IoT sensor. It captures multiple points of data: 
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Lux
* Motion (PIR)


The Droplet is avalible in 3 different models:
* Droplet TH -Temperature & Humidity
* Droplet THL -Temperature, Humidity & Lux
* Droplet THLM -Temperature, Humidity, Lux and Motion (PIR)

# Why LoRa

LoRa® is a low-powered, long-range wireless technology designed for the Internet of Things. 
It is less affected by buildings and other obstructions than regular WiFi and Bluetooth, with one gateway generally being able to provide coverage for a 70x70m, 3 story building.

The LoRa® community is expanding rapidly, with many new contributions and developments occurring every day.

* Significantly longer range compared to Bluetooth and WiFi
* Drastically lower power consumption than for Bluetooth, WiFi, or 4G
* AES128 encryption on data packets
* Excellent penetration through obstacles such as walls and ceilings
* Highly versatile application, which translates into easier integration and a more efficiant installation
