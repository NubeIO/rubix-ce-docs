# Identifying Hardware Version


The Nube iO Wireless Droplet sensor has had a number of hardware improvements since its initial release.  
It is important to know which version of the Droplet you are working with so that the correct versions of manuals and documentation are used.  
Using mismatched devices and documents can result in damage to the device or non-functional configurations.

## Identifying Hardware Version
The Droplet hardware version is printed on the base PCB at the top of the board just below the `NUBE iO` logo.   
The front case of the Droplet must be removed to view the PCB and version number.  

See diagram below.
