# Overview

The MicroEdge is Nube-iO’s multi-purpose wireless (LoRa) IoT asset monitoring sensor.  Designed to interface with low level sensors, pulse sensors (water, electrical, gas, etc.), in a small package, with minimum install time.

LoRa wireless IoT technology provides a very long transmission range that is energy efficient and less susceptible to object interference than other wireless technologies.

The MicroEdge provides 3 analog Inputs, and 1 Digital Pulse Accumulation Input.  Values are sent wirelessly to the gateway controller, making installation hassle free.

Powered by a 4000mAh battery, the MicroEdge has a runtime of 8 - 10 years depending on the configured push rate

## Pulse Input
- Dedicated input for counting and accumulating pulse signals.
- Suitable for measuring flow rates in utilities like water, gas, and electricity.


## U1, UI2 and UI3
The  Universal Inputs can be used as Analog or Digital inputs.
- 10K temp sensors
- On/Off input

# Why LoRa

LoRa® is a low-power, long-range wireless technology designed for the Internet of Things.
It is less affected by buildings and other obstructions than regular WiFi, with one gateway generally being able to provide coverage for a 70x70m 3-story building.

LoRa® is expected to hold 75% of the IoT device market share soon.
The LoRa® community is expanding rapidly, with many new contributions and developments occurring every day.

* Significantly longer range than for Bluetooth and WiFi
* Drastically lower power consumption than for Bluetooth, WiFi, or 4G
* AES128 encryption
* Excellent penetration through obstacles
* Highly versatile application, which translates into easier integration
