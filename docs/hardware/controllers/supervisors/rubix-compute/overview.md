# Overview

This IoT multi-gateway will collect data from both wired and wireless devices. 
It will enable you to aggregate data from multiple sensors and send it anywhere – your cloud, a local server, or 3rd-party hardware.


## One Gateway. Multiple Data Types.
Rubix Compute is a one of a kind IoT gateway that aggregates all types of building data, removing the frustration of running multiple gateways in one solution.
